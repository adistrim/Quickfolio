# Quickfolio

Quickfolio is a minimalist portfolio website about myself. It was originally created in a Coursera coding competition where participants were challenged to build a portfolio website within a limited time frame.

As for the main features it has both dark and light mode and it's responsive enough to work on multiple screen sizes.
